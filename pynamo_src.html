<h1>Exploring the Dynamo Paper in Python</h1>
<p>
Like many other people, I found the 
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/AllThingsDistributed/sosp/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">paper [PDF]</a> 
that describes Amazon's Dynamo system intensely interesting.
</p>
<p>
To fully understand something software-related, I always find it's best to actually write some code.
So I sat down to write an implementation of the key ideas from the Dynamo paper, in Python.
</p>
<p>
In line with this original intent, I should point out that the code here is 
<b>pedagogical</b> rather than practical.  For example,  I deliberately use inefficent 
implementations in places &ndash; I'd rather have a slow implementation that just uses the Python standard
library, than a fast version with distractions (by either requiring additional <code>import</code>s, or
by including implementations of data structure that aren't specific to Dynamo).
</p>
<p>
I've also built the system on top of a simulated network, rather than on top of a real network or web server.
This means I can more easily test different scenarios and track what's going on (more on the framework
<a href="#framework">at the end</a>).
